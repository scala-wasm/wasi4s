   *  This function takes a list of pollables, which identify I/O sources of
   *  interest, and waits until one or more of the events is ready for I/O.
   *
   *  The result `list<u32>` contains one or more indices of handles in the
   *  argument list that is ready for I/O.
   *
   *  This function traps if either:
   *  - the list is empty, or:
   *  - the list contains more elements than can be indexed with a `u32` value.
   *
   *  A timeout can be implemented by adding a pollable from the
   *  wasi-clocks API to the list.
   *
   *  This function does not return a `result`; polling in itself does not
   *  do any I/O so it doesn't fail. If any of the I/O sources identified by
   *  the pollables has an error, it is indicated by marking the source as
   *  being ready for I/O.
